Create a new node:

UI: add a new value to UI_NodeType enum
UI: create a new child struct of Node in nodes.hpp
UI: don't forget to register node with CEREAL and to override its serialize method if node contains data
UI: in NodeEditorUI::handleNodeCreation add new node
BACK: create a new file in include/AudioBackend/Components/NEW_COMPONENT.hpp
BACK: make sure to override all necessary methods: getInputs - clearInputs - addInput - process
BACK: include new file in include/AudioBackend/Components/Components.hpp
in UIToBackendAdapter::allocateAudioComponent describe how the node should be allocated and configured
